## Challenge:  Hunt [Web] 150 Points

Agent, it looks like ARIA has spun up a simple website.  Is there anything you can find to give more information about it's plans?

## Solution:

Part of the flag and a clue can be found by viewing the source of the main page:

```
  <!-- Don't forget to check in on the bots! -->
    <!-- p1: SIVBGR{r1s3_ -->
```

In addition to the three images of robots on the main webpage, I found another, robot.jpeg, in /static/img/robot.jpeg

None of my steganography tools work so still seeking the flag
