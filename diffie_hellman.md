## Challenge:  What's Diffie [Crypto] 150 Points

Alice and Bob have been experimenting with a way to send flags back and forth securely. Can you intercept their messages?

nc 0.cloud.chals.io 32820

## Solution:
### STEP 1:
```
└─$ nc 0.cloud.chals.io 32820 
g =  12
p =  53
a =  8
b =  67
What is their shared secret?
Enter your input: 47
```

How did I compute 47?

### Me
tell me which encoder will translate g=12, p=53, a=8, b=67

### Copilot
The values you’ve provided (g = 12, p = 53, a = 8, b = 67) are typically used in the context of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, which is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. In Diffie-Hellman, g represents the base of the modular exponentiation, p is a prime number modulus, and a and b are private keys chosen by the first and second parties, respectively.

Here’s how the Diffie-Hellman key exchange process works using these values:

Public Information: Both parties agree on the public base g and the public prime modulus p.
Private Keys: Each party selects a private key. Party A chooses a, and Party B chooses b.
Compute Public Keys: Each party computes their public key by raising g to the power of their private key and taking the modulus p. For example, Party A’s public key ( A ) would be ( g^a \mod p ).
Exchange Public Keys: The parties exchange their public keys.
Compute Shared Secret: Each party raises the received public key to the power of their private key and takes the modulus p again to compute the shared secret.
Using the values you’ve provided, the shared secret would be computed as follows:

Party A computes their public key: ( A = g^a \mod p = 12^8 \mod 53 )
Party B computes their public key: ( B = g^b \mod p = 12^{67} \mod 53 )
After exchanging public keys, Party A computes the shared secret: ( S_A = B^a \mod p )
Party B computes the shared secret: ( S_B = A^b \mod p )
If both parties’ calculations are correct, ( S_A ) and ( S_B ) will be equal, providing them with a shared secret key for encryption.

To actually perform these calculations, you would typically use a programming language with support for large integer arithmetic, such as Python, and libraries that can handle modular exponentiation efficiently to avoid issues with large numbers. Here’s a simple Python function that demonstrates the calculation of the public key:

```
def compute_public_key(g, p, private_key):
    return pow(g, private_key, p)

# Example usage:
g = 12
p = 53
a = 8
public_key_a = compute_public_key(g, p, a)
print(f"Public Key for Party A: {public_key_a}")
```
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully.
This function uses Python’s built-in pow function with three arguments, which efficiently computes ( g^a \mod p ) even for very large numbers. Remember, the actual encoding and decoding of messages using the shared secret would involve additional cryptographic functions. If you’re working on implementing this in a real-world scenario, it’s highly recommended to use established cryptographic libraries that provide secure implementations of Diffie-Hellman and other cryptographic algorithms.

### You
add a function to compute the shared secret

### Copilot
Certainly! To compute the shared secret in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, you can use the public key from the other party and your own private key. Here’s a Python function that calculates the shared secret:

I copied this code to a script named, diffie_helman.py
```
def compute_shared_secret(other_public_key, p, private_key):
    return pow(other_public_key, private_key, p)

# Example usage:
g = 12
p = 53
a = 8  # Private key for Party A
b = 67 # Private key for Party B

# Compute public keys
public_key_a = compute_public_key(g, p, a)
public_key_b = compute_public_key(g, p, b)

# Compute shared secrets
shared_secret_a = compute_shared_secret(public_key_b, p, a)
shared_secret_b = compute_shared_secret(public_key_a, p, b)

# The shared secrets should be equal
print(f"Shared Secret for Party A: {shared_secret_a}")
print(f"Shared Secret for Party B: {shared_secret_b}")
```
```
python3 diffie_helman.py       
Shared Secret for Party A: 47
Shared Secret for Party B: 47

```
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully.
This function uses the pow function to compute ( other_public_key^{private_key} \mod p ), which is the shared secret. In the example usage, after computing the public keys for both parties, each party uses the other’s public key to compute the shared secret. If everything is done correctly, shared_secret_a and shared_secret_b should be equal, providing a common secret key that can be used for further encryption.

Remember, this is a simplified example. In a real-world application, you would need to handle larger numbers and more complex scenarios, and it’s recommended to use well-tested cryptographic libraries to ensure security.

### STEP 2:
After finding the shared secret, a second task was revealed that said:
```
To find the flag you will need to perform a bitwise XOR operation between each byte of the encrypted message
and the corresponding byte of the shared secret key = 47.

7c 66 79 6d 68 7d 54 1b 70 49 43 1b 48 70 49 5d 1f 42 70 1b 43 1e 4c 1c 70 1b 41 4b 70 4d 1f 4d 52
```
I had another conversation with Co-pilot:
### You
perform bitwise XOR operation between each byte of 7c 66 79 6d 68 7d 54 1b 70 49 43 1b 48 70 49 5d 1f 42 70 1b 43 1e 4c 1c 70 1b 41 4b 70 4d 1f 4d 52

### Copilot
To perform a bitwise XOR operation on the given bytes, you’ll need to specify the other set of bytes to XOR with. A bitwise XOR operation requires two inputs and outputs a value where the bits of the result are set to 1 if either (but not both) of the corresponding bits in the input operands are 1.

Here’s an example of how a bitwise XOR operation works on two bytes:

Byte 1:  01101100 (0x6C)
Byte 2:  01010101 (0x55)
Result:  00111001 (0x39)

In this example, each bit in the result is set to 1 only if the corresponding bits in Byte 1 and Byte 2 are different.

If you provide the second set of bytes, I can demonstrate the XOR operation for you. Alternatively, if you’re looking to XOR the bytes with themselves or with a specific value, please provide that information, and I’ll be happy to assist you further. If you’re working with Python, here’s a simple function that performs a bitwise XOR operation between two lists of bytes:

```
def xor_bytes(byte_list1, byte_list2):
    return [b1 ^ b2 for b1, b2 in zip(byte_list1, byte_list2)]
```
#### Example usage:
```
bytes1 = [0x7c, 0x66, 0x79, 0x6d, 0x68, 0x7d, 0x54, 0x1b, 0x70, 0x49, 0x43, 0x1b, 0x48, 0x70, 0x49, 0x5d, 0x1f, 0x42, 0x70, 0x1b, 0x43, 0x1e, 0x4c, 0x1c, 0x70, 0x1b, 0x41, 0x4b, 0x70, 0x4d, 0x1f, 0x4d, 0x52]
bytes2 = [0x7c, 0x66, 0x79, 0x6d, 0x68, 0x7d, 0x54, 0x1b, 0x70, 0x49, 0x43, 0x1b, 0x48, 0x70, 0x49, 0x5d, 0x1f, 0x42, 0x70, 0x1b, 0x43, 0x1e, 0x4c, 0x1c, 0x70, 0x1b, 0x41, 0x4b, 0x70, 0x4d, 0x1f, 0x4d, 0x52] # Replace with the actual second list of bytes
result = xor_bytes(bytes1, bytes2)
print(f"XOR Result: {result}")
```

This function takes two lists of bytes, byte_list1 and byte_list2, and returns a new list containing the result of the XOR operation between corresponding elements of the input lists. Replace bytes2 with the actual second list of bytes you want to XOR with bytes1. If you need further assistance with this operation or have any other questions, feel free to ask!

### You
perform a bitwise XOR operation between each byte of the encrypted message
and the corresponding byte of the shared secret key = 47.
```
7c 66 79 6d 68 7d 54 1b 70 49 43 1b 48 70 49 5d 1f 42 70 1b 43 1e 4c 1c 70 1b 41 4b 70 4d 1f 4d 52

To perform a bitwise XOR operation between each byte of the encrypted message and the shared secret key (47), we’ll first convert the hexadecimal values of the encrypted message to decimal, then XOR each with the decimal value of 47 (which is 2F in hexadecimal), and finally convert the results back to hexadecimal.

Here’s the Python code to perform this operation:

```
# Encrypted message in hexadecimal
encrypted_message_hex = '7c 66 79 6d 68 7d 54 1b 70 49 43 1b 48 70 49 5d 1f 42 70 1b 43 1e 4c 1c 70 1b 41 4b 70 4d 1f 4d 52'.split()

# Shared secret key
shared_secret_key = 0x2F

# Perform XOR operation
decrypted_message_hex = [hex(int(byte, 16) ^ shared_secret_key)[2:].zfill(2) for byte in encrypted_message_hex]

# Join the decrypted bytes into a string
decrypted_message_hex_str = ' '.join(decrypted_message_hex)
print(f"Decrypted Message (Hex): {decrypted_message_hex_str}")
```

This code will output the decrypted message in hexadecimal format. If you want to convert it to a string (assuming it’s ASCII text), you can modify the code to decode the hexadecimal values:

```
# Convert hex to ASCII string
decrypted_message_ascii = ''.join([chr(int(byte, 16)) for byte in decrypted_message_hex])
print(f"Decrypted Message (ASCII): {decrypted_message_ascii}")
```

This will give you the decrypted message in human-readable form if the original encrypted message was ASCII text.
